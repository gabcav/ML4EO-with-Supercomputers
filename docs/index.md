# Welcome to Machine Learning for Earth Observation powered by Supercomputers 

This course exposes the students to the physical principles underlying satellite observations of Earth by passive sensors, as well as parallel Deep Learning (DL) algorithms that scale on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems. 

For the different theoretical concepts (represented by 4 modules), the course provides hands-on exercises. These exercises are part of a project in the context of Remote Sensing (RS) image classification that the students are asked to develop during the whole duration of the course.

## Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course, a student shall be able to:

- design and calculate the properties of systems using amplitude or angle modulation
- describe and implement digital modulation methods and receiving concepts
- explain and calculate the performance of systems in the presence of noise
- describe and explain the limitations faced when designing telecommunication systems
- explain and implement communications among multiple users
- help solving telecommunication problems in the industry
- conduct further studies in telecommunications
