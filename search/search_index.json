These models employ self-supervised learning and Transformer-based architectures to extract structure and meaning from vast amounts of unlabeled data at scale. The course emphasizes how these advanced machine learning paradigms are reshaping EO data analytics beyond classical handcrafted methods. </p> <p>A core theme of the semester is the intersection of large-scale machine learning and HPC. Students will examine how modern supercomputers enable the training and deployment of Geospatial AI foundation models for Earth observation. This includes discussions on distributed training, parallel algorithm design, and performance optimization on HPC infrastructures. The course also covers benchmarking and performance evaluation, introducing students to standardized evaluation frameworks and metrics to assess model scalability, efficiency, and accuracy in real-world Earth observation applications. </p> <p>To integrate theory and practice, students complete a semester-long capstone project. Through hands-on development with Python APIs and open models, students will design, implement, and evaluate machine learning solutions on real EO datasets.
